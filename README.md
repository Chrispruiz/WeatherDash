# WeatherDash
WeatherDash is a site that will pull weather information and a 5-day forecast for a user-specified city.  
# Built With:
* HTML
* Bootstrap/CSS
* JavaScript/Jquery 
* Third-party API - OpenWeatherMap

1. Using grid layouts on Bootstrap, I was able to create a layout with limited CSS edits.
2. Created a search function that pulls from the guery url from Weather Dash and added my user API key at the end of the URL
3. Using local storage, the previously searched cities are saved for quick access for users. This is for a better user experience. 
4. Using the then function, I was able to extract specific information from the third party app using JSON to find the data to pull into my application. 
5. The 5-day forecast cards holds image icons from the OpenWeatherMap as well as the 5-day forecast data.
